#The nbaallelo_log.csv file contains data on 126314 NBA games from 1947 to 2015. The dataset includes the features pts, elo_i, win_equiv, and game_result. Using a sample of the csv file nbaallelo_log.csv and scikit-learn's LogisticRegression() function, construct a logistic regression model to classify whether a team will win or lose a game based on the team's elo_i score. Using scikit-learn's metrics module, calculate the various classification metrics for the model.

#Build a logistic model with default parameters, fit to the input and output features X and y.
#Use the model to predict the classification of instances in X.
#Calculate the confusion matrix for the model.
#Calculate the accuracy for the model.
#Calculate the precision for the model.
#Calculate the recall for the model.
#Calculate kappa for the model.
